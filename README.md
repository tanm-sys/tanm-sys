## About Me

Hello there! I'm **Tanmay Patil** – a self-taught coder with a passion for both technology and tunes.  
I’m a proud jQuery fanboy (yes, even in this modern age) who believes that effective communication is the secret sauce of innovation.  
I like to explore everything—from cutting-edge exploits (for ethical and educational exploration only) to creating dynamic web experiences.

> *"I really like music. Code flows like a symphony, and every line is a beat in the rhythm of creativity."*

## My Passions & Skills

- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, Python, Visual Basic .NET, Rust, and more.
- **Web & UI/UX:** jQuery, modern CSS/HTML, and fluid responsive design.
- **Cybersecurity (Educational):** Ransomware & DoS exploits – strictly for learning and awareness.
- **Communication:** I value clear, creative, and honest communication in every project.
- **Music Lover:** Because sometimes, you need a good playlist to power through a coding session.

## Skill Icons Showcase

Below is a dynamic showcase of my skills, powered by [skillicons.dev](https://skillicons.dev). This section uses fluent icons from the skill‑icons repository to visually represent my tech stack. Feel free to update the icons by changing the comma‑separated list.

  </a>
</p>

*Tip: You can specify a theme by appending `&theme=light` or `&theme=dark` to the URL, and control the number of icons per line with `&perline=10` (or any number between 1 and 50).*
